### Prerequisites

GIT - https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Open your terminal and clone [this](http://github.com/week-4-game/week-4-game.git) repository to your computer. 

```
git clone http://github.com/week-4-game/week-4-game.git

```

Navigate to the `/week-4-game` directory with your terminal

```
cd week-4-game
```

```
explorer .
```

Open the `index.html` file by double clicking on it. The app will open in a web browser and should look like this:


### Folder Structure

## How to Play
When `index.html` is loaded, `assets/javascript/game.js` will generate a random number between 19 and 120 inclusive, which will represent the number of crystals to collect.

`assets/javascript/game.js` will also generate 4 random numbers between 1 and 12, for each crystal. Each time one of these crystals are clicked, the random number generated for that crystal will be added to the Crystals Collected score. The user will know what each crystal is worth by clicking on it.

You win the game if you match your Crystals Collected score with the Crystals to Collect number.

You lose the game if your Crystals Collected score is greater than the Crystals to Collect number.
